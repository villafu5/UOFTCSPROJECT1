## Activity File: Interview Questions

- This first project covers a wide range of topics including cloud, network security, and logging and monitoring.

- When networking and talking to potential employers, you should be able to reference the work done on this project to answer specific interview questions or demonstrate your skills within a specific domain. 

- You will choose a domain that you're interested in pursuing as a career and answer mock questions based on the suggested response format. 
​
### Instructions 

1. Choose one of the following domains:
    - Network security
    - Cloud security
    - Logging and monitoring

    If you are unsure of which domain you want to focus on, that's okay. You can either choose the one you're most comfortable discussing, or complete the tasks in two or all three domains.

2. Select one domain and one question. 

    - Questions are provided for each domain. Choose one to answer from your chosen domain. 
​
3. Write a one-page response that answers the question using specific examples from your work on Project 1. Your response should flow and read like a presentation while keeping the general structure of the technical question response guidelines. 

    You will submit this one-page response. 

#### Reminder: Response Guidelines
As a reminder,  good responses do the following. 
​
1. Restate the problem.
2. Provide a concrete example scenario.
3. Explain the solution requirements.
4. Explain the solution details.
5. Identify advantages and disadvantages of the solution​.
​
Including each of these components will ensure you prove your competency of subject matter and critical thinking. 
​
### Interview Questions by Domain

Below you will find a list of questions, grouped by specific domains. Select one question to answer. 
​ 

For each question, where appropriate, we have provided you with specific prompts to consider as you structure each section of your response. Feel free to use these prompts or your own examples. 

#### Domain: Network Security

**Question 1:  Faulty Firewall**

Suppose you have a firewall that's supposed to block SSH connections, but instead lets them through. How would you debug it?

Make sure each section of your response answers the questions laid out below.
​
1. Restate the Problem

2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario
    - In Project 1, did you allow SSH traffic to all of the VMs on your network?
    - Which VMs did accept SSH connections?
    - What happens if you try to connect to a VM that does not accept SSH connections? Why?

3. Explain the Solution Requirements
    - If one of your Project 1 VMs accepted SSH connections, what would you assume the source of the error is?
    - Which general configurations would you double-check?
    - What actions would you take to test that your new configurations are effective?


4. Explain the Solution Details
    - Which specific panes in the Azure UI would you look at to investigate the problem?
    - Which specific configurations and controls would you check?
    - What would you look for, specifically?
    - How would you attempt to connect to your VMs to test that your fix is effective?

5. Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution

    - Does your solution guarantee that the Project 1 network is now "immune" to all unauthorized access?


    - What monitoring controls might you add to ensure that you identify any suspicious authentication attempts?​
